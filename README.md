Build a Recipe Box

<h3>This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-recipe-box" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can create recipes that have names and ingredients.</li>
  <li>You can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.</li>
  <li>You can click into any of those recipes to view it.</li>
  <li>You can edit these recipes.</li>
  <li>You can delete these recipes.</li>
  <li>All new recipes you add are saved in your browser's local storage. If you refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.</li>
  <li>Somethings went wrong? Reset your local storage by clicking the button at the back of the recipes book.</li>
</ul>

Registration or login still not works. I wanted to hit the minimal user story requirements before start developing the back-end code.
